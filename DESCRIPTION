Description: Lake morphometry metrics are used by limnologists to understand,
    among other things, the ecological processes in a lake. Traditionally, these
    metrics are calculated by hand, with planimeters, and increasingly with
    commercial GIS products. All of these methods work; however, they are either
    outdated, difficult to reproduce, or require expensive licenses to use. The
    lakemorpho package provides the tools to calculate a typical suite
    of these metrics from an input elevation model and lake polygon. The metrics
    currently supported are: fetch, major axis, minor axis,  maximum length, 
    maximum width, mean width,maximum depth, mean depth, shoreline development, 
    shoreline length, surface area, and volume.
