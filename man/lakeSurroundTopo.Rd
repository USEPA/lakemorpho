\title{Calculate surrounding topography for lake}
\usage{
lakeSurroundTopo(inLake, inElev, inCatch = NULL, reso = res(inElev)[1])
}
\arguments{
\item{inLake}{a SpatialPolygons or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame representing the input lake. Required.}

\item{inElev}{a RasterLayer representing the elevation around the lake. Required.}

\item{inCatch}{Optional SpatialPolygons or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame defining the
Surrounding Topography.  Default is NULL wich uses a buffer equal to the
maximum in lake distance.}

\item{reso}{Optional resolution for raster output (e.g. lake distance).
Defaults to the resolution of inElev}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class 'lakemorpho' that includes the surrounding
        topography of the lake.
}
\description{
This function combines all input datasets into a \code{\link{lakeMorphoClass}}.
As a part of this combination, the surrounding topography is also determined.
If no input catchements are used, it is assumed that a buffer equal to the
maximum in lake distance is used. If an input catchement is used, then the 
surrounding topography is the land area represented by the  catchements that 
intersect the lake.
