\title{Function to find line representing maximum lake Width}
\usage{
lakeMaxWidth(inLakeMorpho, pointDens, addLine = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{inLakeMorpho}{An object of \code{\link{lakeMorphoClass}}.  Output of the 
\code{\link{lakeSurroundTopo}} function would be appropriate as input}

\item{pointDens}{Number of points to place equidistant along the 
\code{\link{lakeMaxLength}}. A line that crosses at that point and
extends from shore to shore is calcuated.}

\item{addLine}{Boolean to determine if the selected max length line should be 
added to the inLakeMorpho object.  Defaults to True}
}
\value{
Returns a numeric value indicating the length of the longest
        line perpndicular to the maximum length line.
}
\description{
Maximum lake width is defined as the maximum in lake distance that is 
perpendicular to the maximum lake length.  This function calculates the 
equation of the perpendicular line and repeats that line \code{pointDens}
number of times and returns the longest of those lines.
